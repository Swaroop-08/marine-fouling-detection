AI-Powered Marine Fouling Detection & Classification


ðŸš¢ Project Overview

Marine fouling â€” the buildup of algae, barnacles, mussels, and other organisms on ship hulls â€” significantly impacts naval efficiency. It increases drag, fuel consumption, and maintenance costs. Traditionally, inspections are conducted manually by divers, which is slow, expensive, and prone to errors.

This project introduces an AI-powered, image-based system for intelligent marine fouling management. It automates detection, classifies fouling density, and provides actionable insights through a dashboard.



ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Automated Detection: Identify fouling species on ship hulls using AI.

Density Classification: Categorize fouling into Low, Medium, or High severity levels.

Real-Time Insights: Provide the Navy/Marine operators with a dashboard for maintenance planning.

Scalable Solution: Extendable to submarines, offshore platforms, and underwater sensors.
